## Agenda

* Announcements
    * Gentle code of conduct reminder
* embedded-hal
    * Blanket impls for reference types
        * Error messages are markedly worse than the &mut impl
        * Prevents HALs impl'ing Deref for their own structs
        * Seems rare in the wider Rust ecosystem, not sure why
        * On balance perhaps not the best way to go
    * Time types (https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/177#issuecomment-910396479)
        * Still not clear what one-size-fits-all approach could work
        * Perhaps a Duration trait allowing different storage sizes
        * Might be worth postponing a decision until after e-h 1.0.0 release
        * Duration trait idea was fleshed out more in discussion
* Newsletter
    * Adam's on holiday this week, will add recent announcements to next issue when back
* Write up Send/Sync in book with other platform assumptions / environment?

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
* Commercial involvement Qs
    * Anything we can suggest when people from companies ask how they can help?
        * Hard without a roadmap for what we want to do
        * Maybe it's time to put a roadmap together again
        * Discussed handling money: not something the WG is interested in / probably too difficult, but of course companies wanting to pay for features could consult individuals or sponsor people on GitHub etc
        * Other suggestions for companies looking to contribute money were discussed though this doesn't seem to be a pressing problem at the moment
    * Any commercial testimonials for https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust/issues/337
        * Many people offered to write some commercial testimonials, we'll collect new ones and update the rust-lang embedded page
* embedded-hal
    * Blanket impls for references
* newsletter
    * will add recent announcements
* For next week...
    * Write up our "platform assumptions", send/sync behaviour, why r0 is in asm, etc, as a chapter in the embedded book
    * Maybe strategise how to implement some big svd2rust changes
