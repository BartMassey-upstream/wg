## Agenda

* Announcements
* embedded-hal
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/316: Merged
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/295: Dormant, no big support of going that route. Maybe people can add their opinion on the PR?
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/287: Seems good to go pending resolution of the merge conflict.
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/285: @lulf to have a closer look and ping people so we can make some progress
* cortex-m
    * Merge cortex-m-rt into cortex-m?
        * Adding a new `rt` feature to enable `cortex-m-rt` seems like the most feasible solution to not conflict with other runtimes. Probably some more thoughts and experimentation.

## Last Week's Minutes


* Announcements
    * rust 1.56!
    * Berlin DST ends this Sunday
* embedded-hal
    * Separate buffers for SPI https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/287
    * CAN take 4 https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/314
        * Safety of new_unchecked
    * I2C Nack errors https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/316
* MSRV and Rust 2021 Edition (thejpster)
    * We can bump MSRVs as required, but no need to do so until specifically required for some PR
    * Not clear if any 2021 edition features are immediately useful for cortex-m crates
* ARM Fixed Virtual Platforms (thejpster)
    * Perhaps qemu is a good starting point for virtualised testing?
* HIL testing in general
