## Agenda

* Announcements
    * embedded-text 0.5-beta2 release: https://twitter.com/bugadani/status/1413881352869617671
* embedded-hal
    * invert layout of traits: `spi::nb::write`, `spi::blocking::write`?
        * Generally positive response, worth writing up a PR to get more feedback
    * Use associated Word types instead of type parameters: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/295
        * Less clear what the advantage is compared to the current type parameters, PR description to be updated and we'll revisit next week
    * older PRs
        * Remove the various Default traits: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/289 
            * Positive support
        * Async digital/pin APIs in the async traits PR: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/285
* cortex-m-rt
    * PR for 0.6.15 and 0.7.0
        * Please mention any bug fixes you'd like to see backported to 0.6.15 or fixed in 0.7.0 on the PR threads, https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt/pull/329 and https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt/pull/330
    * static mut transform / resource management?
        * Still unclear what the replacement is. Maybe the new syntax, maybe encourage use of RTIC, maybe just unsafe static mut for those interrupts that want it, maybe a new crate can provide it?
* Communicating work of embedded community to Rust at large
    * I (richarddodd) am not an embedded developer, but was able to get into rust-embedded code fairly easily.
    * Rust is a big opportunity to bring many people into embedded.
    * Get the word out with blog posts etc.?
        * For example a blog post on the `embassy` executor/intrusive linked lists would be v interesting.
* road to 1.0
    * No time this week


## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * cortex-m v0.7.3 released
    * @therealprof has submitted an LLVM patch for unsigned saturating arithemtic on cortex-m
* embedded-hal
    * brief discussion about a potential Duration type or trait, or how it might interact with core's Duration, or embedded-time's Duration
* the road to 1.0 (again!)
    * recapped current state of 1.0 crates
        * r0, nb both 1.0, but we've had to deprecate r0 and might eventually deprecate nb
        * momentum has faltered on cortex-m and cortex-m-rt crates getting to 1.0
        * embedded-hal 1.0 has had a lot of interest and development
    * discussed perhaps pushing more crates towards 1.0 to reflect their current stability and widespread use
    * discussed cortex-m-rt's static mut transformation as a potential blocker on the way to releasing a 1.0
        * Perhaps the interrupt resource management can be turned into a separate crate?
