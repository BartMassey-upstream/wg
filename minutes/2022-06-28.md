    * Remove nb?
        * Extended discussion on this idea. Lots of people do still want to be able to have some sort of nb-like behaviour, but open question if this can be provided on top of async traits without dramatically increasing complexity.
        * Perhaps a prototype wrapper could be explored to see what this interface would look like and whether we can work around the complexity of having to store the futures which may be Pin
