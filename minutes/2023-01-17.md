## Agenda

* WG
    * TYIER
    * Social media policy https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/pull/651
        * Needs updating for Mastodon
* Cortex-M
    * Mysterious bug in semihosting?
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/459
        * Seems likely to be a qemu issue, though we could
          possibly work around with a nop in debug::exit,
          which has pretty low overhead since it's only
          used at the end of tests
    * c-m-rt zero-init RAM PR https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/455
* Embedded HAL
    * PwmPin trait? https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/430
        * New suggestion avoids some extra computation
    * GPIO ErrorKind https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/431#pullrequestreview-1249623337
    * embedded-alloc to HAL team?
        * leave with cortex-m for now
* Risc-V
    * Critical section bug? https://github.com/rust-embedded/riscv/pull/121
        * Yep, merged.

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * TYIER blog post
    * WG social media policy in https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/pull/651
    * svd2rust 0.28.0 released
    * aarch64-cpu 9.3.0, 9.3.1 released
* Cortex-M
    * 0.7.7 released with minor documentation fix for critical-section impl
    * c-m-rt zero-init RAM PR updated https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/455
        * unsure if it should zero before or after pre_init
        * possibly we can skip zeroing bss if all RAM is being zeroed
    * embedded-alloc: cortex-m or hal team?
        * leave it for now?
* Book
    * Atomics discussion https://github.com/rust-embedded/book/issues/338
* Embedded HAL
    * PwmPin: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/430
        * Keep this design or consider alternative with more methods to get maximum duty value?
