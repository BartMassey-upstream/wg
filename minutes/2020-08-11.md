## Agenda

Focus Issues:

* DMA:
 * DMA crate name https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/480
     * Crate created!
 * DMA crate traits https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/486
     * Hopefully publishing first version soon
* C/Rust Interop?

New Nominated Issues:
* Bringing embedded-nal into the wg https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/491
    * Perhaps keep development outside the wg for now?
* Weekly driver initiative
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/39
    * We can probably close this issue
    * But restart the newsletter

Nominated issues from last week:

* C/Rust interop https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/481
    * No update this week
* New InterruptNumber traits https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/455
    * Progress made in svd2rust
* TLSF allocator https://github.com/rust-embedded/alloc-cortex-m/issues/36
    * New PR https://github.com/rust-embedded/alloc-cortex-m/pull/38
* Cortex-M
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/239
* DummyPins HAL https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/237
    * No update this week

Other points:

* What's the status of https://github.com/rust-embedded/fixedvec-rs
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/fixedvec-rs/issues/20
    * Awaiting response
* ARM toolchain download
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt/pull/284
    * Works on cortex-m-rt, to-do on cortex-m and other repos

## Action Items

* Determine if HAL team are to take on the embedded-dma crate
* Investigate if we can use LLVM to build cortex-m pre-built objects, removing the need to install ARM gcc
* Swap cortex-m to use apt to install arm-none-eabi-gcc

## Last Week's Minutes

Nominated issues from last week:

* C/Rust interop https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/481
    * Perhaps a candidate for a focus project?
* DMA crate name https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/480
    * Going ahead with embedded-dma, @thalesfragoso to create repo
* DMA crate traits https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/486
    * Will publish crate soon with 0.0.1 of traits
    * Various implementations in HALs are coming along
* New InterruptNumber traits https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/455
    * We can probably go ahead with the cortex-m and msp430 changes in svd2rust now, but still need to work out what will happen in riscv
* TLSF allocator https://github.com/rust-embedded/alloc-cortex-m/issues/36
    * No update this week
* Cortex-M issues
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/239
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/209
        * More thought needed on Mutex trait
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/169
        * Closed
    * New this week: https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt/issues/283
        * Perhaps not our place to fix SR, and user can write VTOR themselves
* DummyPins HAL https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/237
* What's the status of https://github.com/rust-embedded/fixedvec-rs
    * No highfive setup, rust-embedded/fixedvec-rs#13 has been unreviewed for >1 year
    * Will open issue to investigate
* CI should not download ARM-GCC from Arm's servers. Any ideas for how to get a toolchain more reliably?
    * We can try arm-none-eabi-gcc from apt, which is newer now we're using GHA
    * Investigate on cortex-m-rt

## Last Week's Action Items

* Create new embedded-dma repository and publish first release
* Open InterruptNumber issues on risc-v and msp430 repos
* Open issue on fixedvec to investigate status
* Try using apt's arm gcc on cortex-m-rt
