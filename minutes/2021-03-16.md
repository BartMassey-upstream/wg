    * Quick catch-up on last week's nominated issues
        * the cortex-m bitfields PR https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/282 has asked about the MSRV, adamgreig to reply later
        * the PWM channel reference in embedded-hal was merged ðŸŽ‰ https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/246
        * no update on the managedCS https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/245

    * C/Rust interop https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/481
        * No obvious action to take right now, if someone is interested it would make a nice focus project
    * Split up cortex-m crate https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/239
        * This remains a nice future direction for the crate
        * No immediate plans to execute on it
    * Change allocator in cortex-m-alloc https://github.com/rust-embedded/alloc-cortex-m/issues/36
        * Still interesting, will ping issue
        * Should coordinate with wg-allocators

## Last Week's Minutes

* Annoucements
    * cortex-m 0.7.2 released
* Nominated issues
    * Review old nominated issues and remove tag
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/282
        * Seems good to accept, but need to work out if it's a breaking change
        * We might eventually change API entirely if we use the same API as PACs
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/246
        * Looks fine to merge and just needs rebasing, pinged on issue
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/245
        * Comment left on issue, not enough HAL members in meeting to discuss right now
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/issues/262
        * Since this issue, a rewrite has started, so un-nominating for now
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/237
        * This triggered more extensive discussion, without a clear consensus yet
    * No time this week for further nominated issues
