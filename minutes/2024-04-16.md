## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * svdtools 0.3.14 released
* New format for weekly meetings?
    * Try out a sort of "impl meeting" occasionally (every other week? every month?) where we
      plan to actively work on things in the meeting time instead of purely discussing
    * Try out github discussions to have a per-week topic to collect things to discuss/talk about
        * For example https://github.com/esp-rs/rust/discussions
    * Resume use of nominated label
    * Potential topics for next week:
        * SPI trait documentation: how and when to share the SpiBus
        * Better Delay provider in cortex-m (can be cloned, using either asm::nop or SysTick?)
        * c-m-interrupt-number/c-m-pac-interface
        * update discovery and/or book tooling pages to mention probe-rs instead of openocd
        * deprecate and archive mutex-trait
        * perhaps swap cortex-m back to 0.7 by reverting the 0.8 breaking change and get a 0.7 release out
        * cortex-m-rt release
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/502
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/499
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/498
        * cargo-binutils CI broken preventing a new release
        * remove bors from wg/ops documents
* cortex-m
    * PR for forwarding attributes and visibility on singleton macro
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/522
