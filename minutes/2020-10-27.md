## Agenda

* REC as REWG sub-org: https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/504
    * Small update suggesting core team would prefer REC not become part of REWG, update to follow.
* cortex-m 0.6.4 released
* MSRV policy issues highlighted by cortex-m 0.6.4?
    * Dependency update increased effective MSRV
    * Already discussing changing MSRV policy here: https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/pull/449
* svd2rust breaking change: https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/issues/478
    * No activity this week
* cortex-m-semihosting 0.4.0 breakage https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/271
    * Perhaps release c-m-sh 0.3.6 from original repo with support for up-to c-m 0.7, change `__syscall` in c-m 0.7 to another name, then release c-m-sh 0.4.2 which directly uses c-m 0.7's new `__syscall` (after c-m 0.7 is released)
* cortex-m 0.7 plans

## Action Items

* Revitalise https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/pull/449 to try and work out a new policy
* Possible c-m-sh 0.3.6 release

## Last Week's Minutes

* Potential embedded impl for handle_alloc_error: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66741#issuecomment-706070759
    * No update in last week, will wait and see
* Ping from clippy regarding the empty loop lint: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/6161 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/6162
    * Got feedback from embedded users, thanks!
* REC as REWG sub-org: https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/504
    * No update
* svd2rust breaking change: https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/issues/478
    * Discussed latest 'version 1' proposal
    * breaking changes are simple but widespread throughout HALs
    * no consensus on whether the slight improvement to clarity is worth the breaking change
    * Perhaps a new RFC for that proposal and a tools team vote
* cortex-m-semihosting 0.4.0 breakage https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/271
    * Will attempt to fix in next couple of days with 0.4.1
* corte-m asm::delay broken https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/272
    * Fix seems simple, swap `$$1` for `#1` in llvm_asm call
    * Will attempt to fix soon and release a 0.6.4
* cortex-m 0.7 plans
    * Fix c-m-sh
    * merge panic-itm
