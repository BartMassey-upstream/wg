## Agenda

* Announcements
    * Friday showcase happened on Twitter https://twitter.com/rustembedded/status/1563156111829913600
    * We have published the first releases of _esp-hal_, `no_std` HALs for ESP32, ESP32-C3, ESP32-S2, and ESP32-S3
        * https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal
    * `embassy-futures` released, more embassy crate releases coming soon in the following days
        * https://crates.io/crates/embassy-futures

* Embedded HAL
    * critical-section bloat on msp430/cortex-m?
        * cr1901 continues to investigate
    * SPI traits on Linux?
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/linux-embedded-hal/issues/87
        * hard to work out how to comply with new e-h 1.0 traits using spidev, which handles CS and bus sharing internally
        * might be best to buffer writes in a transaction and send them on read/flush/end-of-transaction
        * not fully compliant but better for many use cases
        * the spibus impl will also be mostly lies, but again there might not be much we can do except document it carefully
    * New I2C trait https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/392
        * No updates this week
    * Split nb https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/394
        * Will rename embedded-hal-can folder to embedded-can and release at version 0.4
        * Will make embedded-hal-nb version 1.0 but hold off releasing for right now
    * New bare-metal?
        * Wait while msp430 and svd2rust stuff gets shaken out
    * Shared singleton macro?
        * Probably prefer static_cell, could even deprecate singleton for c-m 0.8
