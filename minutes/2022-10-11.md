    * riscv 0.9.0 released
        * Possibly get #110 merged for 0.10
* Cortex-M
    * Allocator questions again
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/alloc-cortex-m/issues/36#issuecomment-1272430529
        * Hopefully setting global allocator is stable soon, and between that and critical-section being released we might not need alloc-cortex-m at all

    * Discovered nuisance/bug in Cargo resolver around multiple alpha release dependencies
        * https://github.com/Rahix/shared-bus/pull/38

## Last Week's Minutes

    * embedded-hal-nb v1.0.0-alpha.0, -alpha.1 released
    * embedded-can v0.4.0, 0.4.1 released
    * embedded-hal v1.0.0-alpha.9 released

* Embedded HAL
    * Continued discussion on SPI (and IÂ²C) traits for Linux
        * Conclusion: on balance, keeping the current design seems best, but let's try and implement it properly for Linux to check there are no horrible surprises, and document these edge cases more clearly
