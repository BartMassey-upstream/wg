## Agenda

* Announcements
    * Stabilisation PR for default_alloc_error_handler https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/102318
* Embedded HAL
    * Issue opened for c-s bloat https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/102295
    * PR to split e-h-nb merged :tada:
    * Road to 1.0...
        * Are the SPI traits ready to go?
            * Can't be implemented on Linux spidev
            * Unclear how it interacts with hardware CS and other weird CS modes
            * Maybe requirements around `transaction()` needs loosening to permit some other CS behaviours
                * Perhaps allow end user to configure the hardware to do something unusual (CS per byte, TI mode, hardware CS that may deassert halfway through if it runs out of data, etc), but default must be conformant
            * to be continued
* End of month Twitter roundup  coming soon
