## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
* Embedded HAL
    * critical-section std poisoning?
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/critical-section/pull/26
            * Discussed in depth.
            * We should specify `with`'s behaviour on unwind, and this seems a sensible behaviour
            * Need to check codegen doesn't suffer for typical no-std uses
            * Don't think any changes needed to acquire/release/CriticalSection preconditions
    * c-s bloat on msp430
        * no updates this week
    * spi traits on linux
        * also no updates this week
    * Split nb
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/394
        * updated to have embedded-can 0.4 and embedded-hal-nb 1.0
        * move `embedded-hal` to a subdir now that the split is going to be permanent?
            * Yes (note, no workspace)
