## Agenda

* Announcements
    * svd2rust 0.29 released https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/releases/tag/v0.29.0
* Bors
    * svd, svd2rust repos moved to ghmq
* Book translations
    * No update this week
* Cortex-m
    * Hardfault trampoline https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/476
        * WIP on making it an argument to the exception macro instead of Cargo feature
* svd2rust
    * per-peripheral steal() https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/723
        * discussed this further; some more positive arguments for adding it based on widespread use of Peripherals::steal() to obtain a single peripheral, but need to confirm why Peripherals::steal() sets the global flag that take() checks, and therefore whether per-peripheral steal() should too
* embedded-hal
    * spi Operation::DelayUs https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/462 
        * did not discuss this week


## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * Rust 1.70 on Thursday
* Bors
    * Migrated stm32-rs, let's try cortex-m soon
* Book translations
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/book/pull/356#issuecomment-1550353727
        * concern that if we don't merge it we probably won't see translators volunteering to use it
        * but, some parts are still incomplete: extraction of po templates? merging of po files?
        * the book is published to upstream rust docs, which currently take our current approach to translations: link to externally hosted copies of the book run by the translators
        * if we used pofiles etc, we'd probably have to coordinate with upstream rust docs around this
* cortex-m
    * hardfault trampoline https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/476
        * a default feature is not ideal as PACs typically enable all features
        * discussed making it a flag to the exception macro
* svd2rust
    * per-peripheral steal()? https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/717
        * discussed briefly; generally negative opinions:
            * it may encourage more stealing to work around ownership
            * it doesn't currently set the DEVICE_PERIPHERALS flag, unlike the overall steal()
* Embedded HAL
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/462
        * didn't discuss this week
