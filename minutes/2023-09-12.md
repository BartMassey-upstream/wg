## Agenda

* Announcements
    * gpio-cdev 0.6 released
    * svdtools moved to wg tools team
* embedded-io WriteAllError: issue thread opened https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/501
    * Further discussion: we perhaps do need to allow Ok(0) to be returned when
      write() is given an empty slice, so it has to _sometimes_ be allowed to
      return Ok(0), which rules out changing the type to NonZeroUsize.
      Debated whether write_all should panic or loop forever on Ok(0), seems
      panic is the better option, especially as the panic overhead is lower in
      newer Rust compiler versions.
