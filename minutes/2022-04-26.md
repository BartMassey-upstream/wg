## Agenda

* Announcements
    * riscv 0.8.0 released, including always-used inline asm
    * svd2rust 0.23 released
* cortex-m
    * new release :tm:
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/430
        * Documentation update required
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/433
        * Needs thinking about in the context of swapping to critical-section; perhaps just don't pass the CriticalSection token into the closure so that the only promise is that interrupts are disabled for this core, but you can't use it to access a Mutex
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/431
        * Currently has some unrelated changes, possibly the priority grouping could be standalone and backported to 0.7, with the other breaking changes in a separte PR and only for 0.8
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/434
        * Not clear why this fix is required
        * Might be linker dependent
