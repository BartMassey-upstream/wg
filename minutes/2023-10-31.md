## Agenda

* Announcements
* Anti-spam bot
    * No issues so far, so let's say no longer provisional and will just deal with anything as it occurs
* Rust target maintainers
    * PR submitted, no response yet
    * https://github.com/davidtwco/rust/pull/1
* cortex-m-interrupt-number
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/488
    * Haven't yet checked if this is non-breaking but still expect so
    * Plan for moving PACs off of c-m-rt too?
        * the main issue is the interrupt macro, which currently the PAC re-exports along with an alias to its own interrupt enum
        * proposal is for users to directly use `#interrupt(pac::Interrupt)` from c-m-rt instead
        * conceivably we could require PACs have `Interrupt` at the top level, so the macro only needs a reference to the PAC itself
        * some discussion about possible syntax for the interrupt macro
        * perhaps c-m-i-n should be called something else, like c-m-pac-interface or c-m-pac or c-m-interrupts or...?
            * we can use this crate to document the entire expected interface for a cortex-m PAC, so it can be relied on by cortex-m, cortex-m-rt, RTIC, etc, and implemented by svd2rust, chiptool, raltool, etc
* mutex trait
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/mutex-trait/issues/13
    * open an RFC to deprecate and archive mutex-trait
* embedded-alloc
    * new release? https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-alloc/pull/81
* heapless 0.8 release
    * more or less ready, remaining PRs could be 0.8.1 as not breaking
* svd2rust: Vector should be repr(C) https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/issues/755
* book: tooling page needs updating
* bors: ops docs needs updating

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * New libs team created, with @dirbaio and @newam as the first members
    * heapless and volatile-register are now looked after by the new libs team
    * embedded-alloc and qemu-exit are moved to the libs team
    * new volatile-register 0.2.2 released with fix for struct repr
    * embedded-io 0.6.1 released with SliceWriteError made public
    * svd2rust 0.30.2 released
    * svd-rs 0.14.3 released
* Anti-spam bot check
* Rust target maintainers
    * PR submitted, no response yet
    * https://github.com/davidtwco/rust/pull/1
* cortex-m-interrupt-number
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/488
    * AG to verify this doesn't cause problems then we could probably release it
    * We should also make a plan to move PACs off cortex-m-rt too, so both c-m and c-m-rt can have major new versions without requiring every PAC to upgrade first.
* mutex trait
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/mutex-trait/issues/13
* book: tooling page needs updating
* bors: ops docs needs updating
* heapless release of version 0.8
    * Plan is to merge whatever open PRs are mergeable and release 0.8 soon
