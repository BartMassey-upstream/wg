## Agenda

* Announcements
    * micro:bit rewrite of discovery book nearing completion!
* Discovery book
    * Discussed how to organise multiple books
    * Perhaps one subfolder per book, all in the same repo, with a landing page that links to each book
    * The new micro:bit becomes the main and recommended book, but we keep hosting the old one for people with an f3
    * A new risc-v version of the book can be written and live alongside these two
        * Perhaps using the Longan Nano?
        * HiFive inventor?
        * The risc-v version can be "extension chapters" to the main discovery book, covering risc-v without recovering the introductory material
* Commercial involvement:
    * We sometimes get people from companies asking how they can help; what can we do to get them involved?
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust/issues/337 asking about new testimonials from embedded users to help demonstrate Rust's industrial use
    * To discuss next week
