## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * smoltcp 0.8.2 released! https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#082---2022-11-27
* Mastodon account
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/647
* Critical-section 0.2
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/critical-section/pull/31
    * Discussed this point at length
    * Yanking 0.2 will break builds for various users with it in their dependency tree,
      especially via atomic-polyfill 0.1 via heapless, or defmt-rtt 0.3
    * Releasing 0.2.8 that uses 1.1 internally will fix some use-cases (and not break builds
      that don't actually _use_ the atomics), but will break users that were relying on
      a default impl
    * could also release a new atomic-polyfill 0.1.x that depends on c-s 1.1 to help
      force migration e.g. of heapless users, though this also breaks users that depended
      on the default impls
    * decided on balance to go with the 0.2.8 release and yank older 0.2.x releases
* svd2rust cluster support
