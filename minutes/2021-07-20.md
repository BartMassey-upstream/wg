## Agenda

* Announcements
    * None this week
* embedded-hal
    * Invert layout of traits? https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/298
        * There was some worry that this would result in lots of copies of a module named `blocking` in scope due to e.g. `use e_h::spi::blocking`, but perhaps in practice users would either `use e_h::spi` and then bound `T: spi::blocking::Write`, or just use the trait directly.
        * This also allows shared items such as Errors to go into the top-level modules.
    * Associated Word types https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/295
        * Lots of discussion happening on the PR thread, so no further discussion in meeting this week.
    * Remove the various Default traits: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/289
        * Consensus seems to be for removal.
    * Any other PRs?
* cortex-m
    * PR for 0.6.15 and 0.7.0: review from cortex-m team?
* showcase
    * Needs updating to use GHA, @adamgreig to do after meeting
* blog
    * Blocked on posting for help with cross maintainership, hopefully real soon now

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * embedded-text 0.5-beta2 release: https://twitter.com/bugadani/status/1413881352869617671
* embedded-hal
    * invert layout of traits: `spi::nb::write`, `spi::blocking::write`?
        * Generally positive response, worth writing up a PR to get more feedback
    * Use associated Word types instead of type parameters: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/295
        * Less clear what the advantage is compared to the current type parameters, PR description to be updated and we'll revisit next week
    * older PRs
        * Remove the various Default traits: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/289 
            * Positive support
        * Async digital/pin APIs in the async traits PR: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/285
* cortex-m-rt
    * PR for 0.6.15 and 0.7.0
        * Please mention any bug fixes you'd like to see backported to 0.6.15 or fixed in 0.7.0 on the PR threads, https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt/pull/329 and https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt/pull/330
    * static mut transform / resource management?
        * Still unclear what the replacement is. Maybe the new syntax, maybe encourage use of RTIC, maybe just unsafe static mut for those interrupts that want it, maybe a new crate can provide it?
* Communicating work of embedded community to Rust at large
    * I (richarddodd) am not an embedded developer, but was able to get into rust-embedded code fairly easily.
    * Rust is a big opportunity to bring many people into embedded.
    * Get the word out with blog posts etc.?
        * For example a blog post on the `embassy` executor/intrusive linked lists would be v interesting.
* road to 1.0
    * No time this week
