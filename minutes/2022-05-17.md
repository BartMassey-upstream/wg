        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/430 update documentation
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/433
            * We will be swapping cortex-m to use critical-section
            * Discussion on what to do with critical-section
            * Transfer crate/repo to REWG
            * Release 0.3 and then 1.0
            * Have bare-metal just re-export the CriticalSection token from c-s 1.0
            * Possibly move bare-metal's Mutex inside c-s 1.0 too
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/431 can we split the priority grouping out for 0.6 and keep the breaking changes for 0.7?
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/437
* embedded hal
    * Merged https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/382 to re-add default methods on async SPI
    * discussion about additional CAN functionality: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/381#issuecomment-1116763861
        * Still doesn't seem to make sense to put config in e-h
        * Second opinion on: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/384
            * Looks good?
