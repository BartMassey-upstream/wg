* cortex-m
    * cortex-m-rt https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt/pull/337 merged, maybe new release soon?
    * should we reconsider cortex-m-rt writing to SP and VTOR at boot?
        * it _shouldn't_ be necessary except to work around broken bootloaders, debuggers, etc
        * it doesn't add _much_ overhead
        * it turns out it's permissible to write to a non-existent VTOR on ARMv6
        * with global_asm, we could easily feature-gate to make this an optional quirks-mode thing, but without it we'd need to ship many more precompiled blobs
* embedded-hal
    * alpha.6 released!
