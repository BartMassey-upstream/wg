## Agenda

* Announcements
    * embedded-hal-bus 0.2 released with AtomicDevice
    * Target docs for thumb targets PR underway: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/124404
    * @thejpster stepping down from wg and leadership council
    * next week's meeting is skipped, resuming the week after (on 14th may)
* Embedded HAL
    * AtomicDevice use of portable_atomic means build fails on armv6 https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/598
        * add atomic-device feature, enable AtomicDevice if feature is enabled or cfg(target_has_atomic..), add atomic-critical-section and atomic-unsafe-assume-single-core (or portable-atomic-...?) which proxy to p-a and also enable atomic-device, document this, release as 0.3
* Tooling docs update: https://github.com/CodingInGreen/tooling
    * what to add?
    * discussed a few topics and organisations
* Maintenance of STM32 Discovery Book?
    * Is our most complete book
    * Does not seem to be in widespread use anymore
    * Board has changed version
    * Two books is a lot
    * Conclusion: don't worry about the stm32 book, mark it as more clearly archived/read-only/deprecated

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * cortex-m-rt 0.7.4 released, no bug reports yet!
    * svd2rust 0.33.1 released
    * microbit 0.14.0 and nrf*-hal 0.17.1 released
* Embedded HAL
    * Should SPI ExclusiveDevice document the initial level of the CS pin? https://github.com/almindor/mipidsi/issues/129#issuecomment-2067713648
        * Decided to have new() set CS high, but this will be a 0.2 release due to breaking API change
    * AtomicDevice https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/579
        * looks good, will want to be sure docs are clear where it's expected to be used
* Cortex M
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/383
* Update tooling section
    * Adam H's question - general outline for more research?
* Should quickstart be updated?
    * Yes, needs to use latest cortex-m and cortex-m-rt and could reference probe-rs instead of openocd
* Target docs update - tell people about target-cpu and target-feature?
    * thejpster has a proposed update https://github.com/jonathanpallant/armtesting/tree/main/armtesting
