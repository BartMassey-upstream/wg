    * Approved, to be transferred soon

* book: tooling page still needs updating
* bors: ops documentation still needs updating

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
* svdtools to wg/tools team?
    * generally in favour, @adamgreig to make issue to vote on moving
        * also talk about deprecating/removing python version
        * check copyright status of included example svd file
* aarch64-cpu re-export tock-registers? https://github.com/rust-embedded/aarch64-cpu/issues/19
    * and if so, major/minor/patch bump?
    * yes to re-export, minor version bump
* embedded_io::WriteAllError propagation
    * discussed the problem in some detail
    * perhaps embedded_io::write() could be forbidden from returning Ok(0),
      instead using an error to signal "can't write any more"
          * but, this is inconsistent with std::io::write, and with read
* book: tooling page still needs updating
* bors: ops documentation still needs updating
