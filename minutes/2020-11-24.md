## Ecosystem gossip



### project groups


#### portable simd group
https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2948
https://github.com/rust-lang/stdsimd
looks like work will hit core, but it Looks like 'acle' the arm dsp simd isnt being represented


#### Rust Error handling Project Group
https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/09/18/error-handling-wg-announcement.html
https://github.com/rust-lang/project-error-handling
Talking about `core::Error`
How will this interact with the dreaded core::io error keeping us from read and write traits?


#### Allocators WG 

Custom Allocators Are starting to be merged
https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-allocators/issues/7

How would custom allocators come to core?
https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-allocators/issues/24




### Compiler stuff
Did you know you could mix thumb and arm instructions in nightly? Theres an rfc being implemented for that
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74727


### Mathy stuff


Theres open discussion on having the underlying rust 'libm' port allow pure 32 bit math. That seems relevant if anyone here can help
https://github.com/rust-lang/libm/issues/248#issuecomment-732288377


### Cargo stuff
Linking emitted from build scripts??
https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/linker-options-in-cargo-toml/13406/11

Proposal: Move some cargo config settings to Cargo.toml
https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/proposal-move-some-cargo-config-settings-to-cargo-toml/13336



You might have seen features resolver in the wild
https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8088
a nightly change that can fix good old 5730 where your build dependencies leak std into our no_std dev dependencies
Just use nightly and add to your .cargo/config and no more build.rs scripts polluting your no_std crate with std
[unstable]
features = ["host_dep"]

If thats interesting to you may also be interesting new "Weak dependencies" being implemented
