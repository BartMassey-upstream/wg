## Agenda

* Announcements
* bors deprecation
    * Seems OK on wg
    * riscv PR merged https://github.com/rust-embedded/riscv/issues/133
        * will see how it goes there
    * Try next on cortex-m or e-h?
* book translations https://github.com/rust-embedded/book/pull/356
    * discussed this at length this week
    * advantages to this approach include centralising translations in one place, making it easier for people to work together on translations, keeping translations inside the wg repo and on the wg-published page, and preventing translations ending up out of date
    * however, it may be harder for potential translators to use, and adds review burden to the wg which may be difficult to fulfil
    * the current PR doesn't cover po/pot file updates when the english content changes
    * it was also suggested we try and find a first translation using this scheme to help it stick
* embedded-hal
    * remove spi write-only/read-only traits https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/461
    * add operation::delayus https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/462

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
* bors deprecation https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/671
* pt-br translation of discovery book https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/pull/523
* Cortex-M
    * Make HardFaultTrampoline optional? https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/406
* Still looking for new maintainers for aarch64-cpu crate
* embedded-hal
    * More people have appeared needing to delay inside an spi transaction, so maybe adding a Delay(microseconds: u32) operation to the enum is a worthwhile idea
        * Discussed this further, no conclusions yet
