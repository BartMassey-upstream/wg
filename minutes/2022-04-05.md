## Agenda

* Announcements
    * Rust 1.60 on Thursday!
    * Potential for an embedded-focused CTCFT:
        * https://github.com/rust-lang/ctcft/issues/30
* svd2rust design questions
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/583
        * Discussed what the use cases might be for these constants to justify the tradeoff in worse compilation times
        * Possibly they allow some more creative HALs beyond what's possible with the existing read/write API but perhaps that API needs to be extended instead?
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/541
* Cortex-M
    * Added HIL tests :tada:
