## Agenda

* Announcements
* Is anyone interested in helping run a rust-embedded Mastodon account?
    * Yep, https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/647 opened to track progress
* Yank critical-section 0.2?
    * Only 4 crates on crates.io still using it exclusively
        * https://crates.io/crates/alkyn
        * https://crates.io/crates/defmt-serial
        * https://crates.io/crates/web-embedded-hal
        * https://crates.io/crates/critical-once-cell
        * rp2040-hal and everything depending on it... https://github.com/rp-rs/rp-hal/blob/main/rp2040-hal/Cargo.toml#L32-L34 -- rp2040-hal uses both (in a way that guarantees that nobody accidentally uses the old version) but prevents yanking the old version :) 
    * Open issue/PR on those 4 crates, wait for rp2040-hal release without it, wait a month and then yank.

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * cortex-m-rt 0.7.2 released
        * MSRV bumped to use new stable asm, no more precompiled blobs
        * Adds set-vtor and set-sp features
    * riscv 0.10 released with critical-section impl
    * a few new async crates using e-h-a and e-n-a (and new crates released from embassy):
        - reqwless 0.2 - async http client
        - esp8266-at-driver
        - es-wifi-driver
        - rak811-at-driver
        - hts221-async
* Async interrupt registration, take 3 (only in HAL approach)
    * The other end of the spectrum, no crate needed only a simple macro-by-example in a HAL + marker trait. When HALs are not forced to adhere to an API via a crate (eg `cortex-m-interrupt`), will it be enough with the simpler solution that needs to be disiminated in a different way?
* Newsletter: looking for volunteers
* Maybe run another last-friday-of-the-month Twitter project roundup?
* Discussed structure of driver crates offering both blocking and async drivers
