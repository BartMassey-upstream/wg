## Agenda

* Announcements
    * Inline asm hopefully stabilising soon! https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/72016#issuecomment-964186287
* cross
    * Reviving the call for new maintainers https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross/issues/574
    * New org for cross maintenance?
        * Keep this under rust-embedded control?
        * Or just add new maintainers to existing repo?
    * rust-lang/infra have a meeting in a week, could ask for their opinion (they use cross?)
    * new Matrix room for cross: https://matrix.to/#/#cross-rs:matrix.org
* embedded-hal
    * Remove traits with Time associated types https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/324
        * Removes a lot of traits, which might make 1.0 quite unappealing until it has them back, or lead to people using 0.2 and 1.0 together
        * On the other hand, the unbound Time type might mean these traits are already rarely used in drivers, in which case they might not be missed from 1.0
        * Perhaps we should take them out now and consider re-adding in a 1.1 if people complain or miss them, even if we can't fix Time for good yet
* cortex-m
* svd2rust
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd/issues/164 : Proposal: struct instead of enum for arrays
        * Maybe `serde(untagged)` would work well
        * Discuss on issue thread
* newsletter

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
* embedded-hal
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/316 : Merged
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/295 : Dormant, no big support of going that route. Maybe people can add their opinion on the PR?
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/287 : Seems good to go pending resolution of the merge conflict.
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/285 : @lulf to have a closer look and ping people so we can make some progress
* cortex-m
    * Merge cortex-m-rt into cortex-m?
        * Adding a new `rt` feature to enable `cortex-m-rt` seems like the most feasible solution to not conflict with other runtimes. Probably some more thoughts and experimentation.
