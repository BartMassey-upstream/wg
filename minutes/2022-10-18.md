## Agenda

* Announcements
    * IRC bridge currently broken both ways
* Cortex-M
    * Does the cortex-m critical section implementation have the problem described in https://github.com/rust-embedded/riscv/issues/116?
        * The implementation is basically the same:
            * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/blob/master/src/critical_section.rs#L11
        * But, it's not clear it can cause an actual problem
        * Since interrupt::disable is safe, an interrupt could disable interrupts
          in between acquire() checking if interrupts are enabled and disabling them,
          so release() would re-enable interrupts
        * However, any code inside the critical section could also disable interrupts and they'd get re-enabled afterwards, and in general code shouldn't rely on being able to disable interrupts with disable() and having them stay disabled forever after
        * So, it doesn't seem like this should cause issues on cortex-m
* svd2rust
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/673
* Interrupt handles for helping async HAL development (@korken89)
    * At work we have been (slowly) adding experimental async support over multiple HALs and noticed that generic interrupt allocation for async drivers is lacking in the ecosystem
    * We see our PoC as an extension to the existing interrupt allocation in `cortex-m-rt`
    * Trying to find an agnostic an interrupt and getting a handle to register a hander to it, so HALs can depend on the trait provided and know they can get interrupt allocated via the interface.
    * PoC: https://github.com/datdenkikniet/cortex-m-interrupt
    * Based on embassy's `take!` macro but with a different take

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * svd2rust 0.26 released
    * riscv 0.9.0 released
        * Possibly get #110 merged for 0.10
* Cortex-M
    * Allocator questions again
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/alloc-cortex-m/issues/36#issuecomment-1272430529
        * Hopefully setting global allocator is stable soon, and between that and critical-section being released we might not need alloc-cortex-m at all
* Embedded HAL
    * Discovered nuisance/bug in Cargo resolver around multiple alpha release dependencies
        * https://github.com/Rahix/shared-bus/pull/38
