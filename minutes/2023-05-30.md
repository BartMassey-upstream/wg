## Agenda

* Announcements
    * Rust 1.70 on Thursday
* Bors
    * Migrated stm32-rs, let's try cortex-m soon
* Book translations
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/book/pull/356#issuecomment-1550353727
        * concern that if we don't merge it we probably won't see translators volunteering to use it
        * but, some parts are still incomplete: extraction of po templates? merging of po files?
        * the book is published to upstream rust docs, which currently take our current approach to translations: link to externally hosted copies of the book run by the translators
        * if we used pofiles etc, we'd probably have to coordinate with upstream rust docs around this
* cortex-m
    * hardfault trampoline https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/476
        * a default feature is not ideal as PACs typically enable all features
        * discussed making it a flag to the exception macro
* svd2rust
    * per-peripheral steal()? https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/717
        * discussed briefly; generally negative opinions:
            * it may encourage more stealing to work around ownership
            * it doesn't currently set the DEVICE_PERIPHERALS flag, unlike the overall steal()
* Embedded HAL
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/462
        * didn't discuss this week

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
* Bors
    * Continuing to bide our time
* Embedded HAL
    * remove spi write-only/read-only traits https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/461
        * merged
    * add operation::delayus https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/462
        * Discussed this point at length
        * Settled on:
            * Keep `Operation::DelayUs`
            * Document that it should be supported by the SpiDevice provider
            * Consider adding embedded-hal-bus convenience methods that construct a SpiDevice provider which will panic on delay, so that it doesn't need a delay provider to be passed in when constructed
            * Don't add "DelayNotSupported" error kind
            * Might require cloneable DelayUs in e-h-b to avoid keeping the delay in the refcell
* svd2rust
    * per-peripheral steal() https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/717
* cortex-m
    * hardfault trampoline https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/476
* Book translations
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/book/pull/356#issuecomment-1550353727

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
* bors deprecation
    * Seems OK on wg
    * riscv PR merged https://github.com/rust-embedded/riscv/issues/133
        * will see how it goes there
    * Try next on cortex-m or e-h?
* book translations https://github.com/rust-embedded/book/pull/356
    * discussed this at length this week
    * advantages to this approach include centralising translations in one place, making it easier for people to work together on translations, keeping translations inside the wg repo and on the wg-published page, and preventing translations ending up out of date
    * however, it may be harder for potential translators to use, and adds review burden to the wg which may be difficult to fulfil
    * the current PR doesn't cover po/pot file updates when the english content changes
    * it was also suggested we try and find a first translation using this scheme to help it stick
* embedded-hal
    * remove spi write-only/read-only traits https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/461
    * add operation::delayus https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/462
