## Agenda

* Announcements
* Nominated Issues
* embedded-hal
    * Discussed supporting DMA in E-H traits
        * The current non-blocking traits using `nb` can't support DMA
        * No point for implementations to use DMA in blocking traits
        * The planned `futures` traits could support DMA, but are blocked on GATs
        * A non-futures approach might be possible, but probably also wants GATs
    * Reorg PR ready to merge https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/278
* cortex-m
    * c-m-rt backport release?
        * Will manually merge the backport since Travis is broken, then we can cut a release
* tools
* resources
    * Discovery book still needs help
    * One week til next blog post
    * New showcase project
