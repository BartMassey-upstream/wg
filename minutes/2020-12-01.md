## Agenda

* Action item recap
* Announcements: MSRV update merged
* Scheduled CI for repos
    * Test on one repo first, then copy to others
    * How do we want notifications? Matrix/IRC, email, opening an issue?
    * Seems like opening an issue is perhaps best, investigate details in a PR
* cortex-m releases
    * need to get a c-m-sh that supports c-m 0.7 out
    * annoyingly stuck with dependencies
    * might be easiest to do c-m-sh 0.3.6 with c-m 0.7 support first
* svd2rust recent AVR breakage
    * we don't currently officially support or test for AVR
    * perhaps someone from avr-rust can add official support, or even form an AVR team in the WG, but even if not we should fix the recent bug

## Action Items

* Newsletter release
    * Mention MSRV policy
* Implement scheduled CI for one repository to check how it works,
  with a view to rolling the same recipe out to other repos aftewards.
* Investigate potential for cortex-m 0.6.5 semver hack
* cortex-m-rt release
* svd2rust release

## Last Week's Agenda

* Announcements of interesting issues/RFCs/discussions (see below)
* MSRV policy update
    * Vote please!
* cortex-m releases
    * To be looked at this week, see action items
* Deprecate / Yank `r0` due to fundamental soundness issues?
    * Summary:
        * Don't touch r0 for now
        * Talk to other users and the UCG folks about long term implications
        * Consider using assembly for r0 in c-m-rt

## Last Week's Action Items

* Mention call for MSRV feedback in newsletter and Twitter
* Prepare newsletter release
* Investigate releasing a cortex-m 0.6.5 with 0.7.0 support
* Look in to cortex-m-rt release(s)
