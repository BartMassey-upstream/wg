    * Hardfault trampoline https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/476
        * no update this week
* svd2rust
    * per-peripheral steal()
        * Need to document safety requirements
* critical-section
    * need to publish updated docs, maybe with extra example
        * perhaps with a list of implementations in the readme
* embedded-hal
    * embedded-io merged into embedded-hal repo
    * async SPI ExclusiveDevice moved to embedded-hal-bus
    * serial traits...

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * Rust 1.71 on Thursday
* Cortex-A team/repo
    * PRs incoming: note that aarch64 is maintained by cortex-a team, add to wg readme list
* Bors
    * Ongoing
* Cortex-M
    * Hardfault trampoline https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/476
        * no update this week
* svd2rust
    * per-peripheral steal() https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/723
        * ready to merge?
        * need documentation about safety requirements
* embedded-hal
    * embedded-io adding to embedded-hal repo
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/466
        * ready to merge
        * followup PR to expand docs around required semantics
        * discuss next week if we need e-h to re-export e-io traits
    * e-h-b: (temporarily) access bus through ExclusiveDevice?
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/467
        * need to ensure any changes aren't immediately overwritten from another thread
        * perhaps a closure that gives temporary access to the inner bus?
        * noted that this probably won't be necesssary from Linux where spidev handles changing clock speed per-device already
    * road to 1.0
        * transition guide
        * validating traits in hals and drivers
        * serial traits
            * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/349#issuecomment-1499465364
