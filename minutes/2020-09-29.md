cortex-m: Road to 1.0

* Work out required actions for c-m-sh and merge
* Release 0.7 soon thereafter
    * This also unblocks svd2rust
* Plan to release 1.0 as the next release
    * Including new Mutex
    * Probably including splitting cortex-m into a few crates which can be used separately


## Last Week's Minutes

Action items:
* None

Nominated issues:
* REC as REWG sub-org: https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/504
* HAL:
    * ManagedCS: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/245
        * Looks good but needs a bit more thought
    * Dummy GPIO pins: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/237
        * Perhaps can wait until 1.1
    * `rand::RngCore` for blocking RNG trait: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/128
        * option 2 seems most promising for e-h 1.0
    * Change reference implementation to something more maintained: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/156
        * updated
