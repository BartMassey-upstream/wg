## Agenda

* Announcements
    * svd2rust: Lots of activity, v0.27.x released. ðŸŽ‰
    * IRC bridge has been restored
* critical-section follow-up
    * Hacky solution for the MSP430 bloat on the horizon, watch the space.
    * No new insights on potential ordering problems for Cortex-M
* Interrupt handles for async HAL development
    * Approach currently under testing. Feedback still sought after... :wink:
    * Documentation has improved since last week: https://github.com/datdenkikniet/cortex-m-interrupt
* embedded-hal
    * No news but maybe we can push for 1.0 until the end of the year
* Blog
    * Has been dormant for a while. ðŸ˜¢ Would be nice to get back into the game...

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * IRC bridge currently broken both ways
* Cortex-M
    * Does the cortex-m critical section implementation have the problem described in https://github.com/rust-embedded/riscv/issues/116?
        * The implementation is basically the same:
            * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/blob/master/src/critical_section.rs#L11
        * But, it's not clear it can cause an actual problem
        * Since interrupt::disable is safe, an interrupt could disable interrupts
          in between acquire() checking if interrupts are enabled and disabling them,
          so release() would re-enable interrupts
        * However, any code inside the critical section could also disable interrupts and they'd get re-enabled afterwards, and in general code shouldn't rely on being able to disable interrupts with disable() and having them stay disabled forever after
        * So, it doesn't seem like this should cause issues on cortex-m
* svd2rust
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/673
* Interrupt handles for helping async HAL development (@korken89)
    * At work we have been (slowly) adding experimental async support over multiple HALs and noticed that generic interrupt allocation for async drivers is lacking in the ecosystem
    * We see our PoC as an extension to the existing interrupt allocation in `cortex-m-rt`
    * Trying to find an agnostic an interrupt and getting a handle to register a hander to it, so HALs can depend on the trait provided and know they can get interrupt allocated via the interface.
    * PoC: https://github.com/datdenkikniet/cortex-m-interrupt
    * Based on embassy's `take!` macro but with a different take
