## Agenda

* Announcements
    * @dirbaio joins the HAL team :tada: 
    * svd2rust 0.25.0 released :tada:
    * efm32-rs project https://github.com/efm32-rs
* Embedded HAL
    * PR to remove IoPin
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/393
    * PR for new I2C bus/device traits
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/392
    * PR to split nb and can into separate crates
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/394
    * Should CAN receive traits block until a frame is ready?
        * Can work this out separately if CAN is removed from e-h proper, since it's no longer a blocker for 1.0; perhaps an "avaialble" or "peek" method.
    * Roadmap to embedded-hal v1.0, what's missing?
        * Issue is more or less up to date, not much now! Perhaps a beta.1 release after outstanding PRs are merged
