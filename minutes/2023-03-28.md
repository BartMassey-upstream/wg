## Agenda

* Announcements
    * e310x svd2rust version update https://github.com/riscv-rust/e310x/pull/28
* Embedded HAL
    * New i2c merged: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/440
    * SPI new transactional API: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/443
        * We discussed this at some length
        * It seems there are still some use cases for the closure-based API that are not met by the slice API
            * Some chips require CS kept asserted while various things happen eg MAX3421
            * Some displays might want to read-modify-writeback a lot of data inside a transaction
            * If the user-provided data needs conversion (eg u16 to u8 with endian swap) this is more efficient inside a closure
        * But, most use cases are probably fine with the slice API (or even the plain write/transfer APIs)
        * And the slice API is very compatible with Linux spidev, while the closure one may need hacking if it can work at all
        * Possibly we start with the slice API and consider adding the closure one alongside later, for drivers that specifically need it
    * serial Read, ReadUntilIdle: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/349
        * Discussed the distinction between buffered/unbuffered further.
        * Should read() always return immediately or can it sometimes block?
