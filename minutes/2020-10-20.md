## Agenda

* Potential embedded impl for handle_alloc_error: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66741#issuecomment-706070759
    * No update in last week, will wait and see
* Ping from clippy regarding the empty loop lint: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/6161 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/6162
    * Got feedback from embedded users, thanks!
* REC as REWG sub-org: https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/504
    * No update
* svd2rust breaking change: https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/issues/478
    * Discussed latest 'version 1' proposal
    * breaking changes are simple but widespread throughout HALs
    * no consensus on whether the slight improvement to clarity is worth the breaking change
    * Perhaps a new RFC for that proposal and a tools team vote
* cortex-m-semihosting 0.4.0 breakage https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/271
    * Will attempt to fix in next couple of days with 0.4.1
    * Fix seems simple, swap `$$1` for `#1` in llvm_asm call
* corte-m asm::delay broken https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/272
    * Will attempt to fix soon and release a 0.6.4
* cortex-m 0.7 plans
    * Fix c-m-sh
    * merge panic-itm

## Last Week's Minutes

* New micro:bit
    * This doesn't change our plans for the Discovery book, and if anything might help them.
* Potential embedded impl for handle_alloc_error: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66741#issuecomment-706070759
    * Discussed in the meeting. Check back next week. Mention in newsletter.
* Ping from clippy regarding the empty loop lint: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/6161
    * Restoring the lint for no_std seems sensible
    * Not clear what to suggest users put in the loop though
        * On cortex-m, asm::nop is fine
    * See also further discussion in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/6162

Nominated issues:
* REC as REWG sub-org: https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/504
    * Has been discussed at core team meeting, awaiting feedback
* svd2rust breaking change: https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/issues/478

## Last Week's Action Items

* Mention handle_alloc_error call for testing in newsletter
