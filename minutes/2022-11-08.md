## Agenda

* Announcements
    * alloc-cortex-m 0.4.3 released
    * svd2rust 0.27.2 released
    * riscv-rt 0.10.0 released
    * cortex-a crate renamed aarch64-cpu and released at v9.0
* `cortex-m-interrupt` now with const registration and M:N interrupt:driver connections, feedback welcome
    * https://github.com/datdenkikniet/cortex-m-interrupt/blob/const-approach/cortex-m-interrupt-examples/examples/register_interrupt.rs
* critical-section on msp430 bloat:
    * can be worked-around by putting the msp430 impl inside the c-s crate and removing the 'extern rust' calls
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/critical-section/compare/main...cr1901:msp430-cs:msp430-cs
        * But it's not clear yet how to fix this longer-term, it seems like most likely a bug in LLVM or Rust's inliner
