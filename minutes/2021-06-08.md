## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
* Nominated Issues
* embedded-hal
* cortex-m
    * cortex-m-rt backport 0.6.14 released to support building on non-x86 hosts
* tools
    * cross: currently, [cross is waiting for a (changelog) update](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross/issues/542). But if published as is, cross will [break on windows host](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross/pull/461) due to paths in windows starting with C:, which does not translate well in linux
    * cross: in general could use more active maintenance, but isn't widely used by the embedded WG; could anyone else help maintain or or take ownership?
      a pinned issue with an announcement of "looking for maintainers" and a blog post for it could give it more eyes
* resources
    * Discovery book still needs help
    * Which micro:bit version(s) should the discovery book support?
    * Blog: ready to publish?

## Action Items

* Add call for maintainers to cross repo. Draft: https://hackmd.io/45AEipq2RBaQEnFUk0wABw
* Link from blog and publish new blog post
