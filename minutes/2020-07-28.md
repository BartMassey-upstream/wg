## Agenda

Nominated items from last week:

* https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/481
    * Please leave comments on the issue
    * Revisit next week to see if there's any movement
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/480
    * We'll go with its own crate, perhaps `embedded-dma`
    * Please comment on the issue thread
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/455
    * The related PR in cortex-m#241 landed.
    * The svd2rust issue will wait until cortex-m 0.7 is released with the new InterruptNumber trait
    * For msp430 the old Nr impl wasn't actually used, so can be removed without replacement
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/alloc-cortex-m/issues/36
    * We could transfer tlsf to help maintenance on it
    * Perhaps a new cortex-m-tlsf allocator crate
    * Also noted that there is movement towards allocators on stable no-std Rust soon
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/239
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/209
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/169
* We didn't get to discuss the cortex-m issues above which probably need more careful time; perhaps a dedicated cortex-m team meeting is called for

New nominated items:

* https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/486
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/237

Closed issues from last week:
* New associated const PTRs added to cortex-m and svd2rust
* InterruptNumber trait landed in cortex-m
* build script re-added to cortex-m-quickstart

## Action Items

* Open issues on risc-v and msp430 arch crates about InterruptNumber changes

## Last Week's Minutes

Announcements:

* [cortex-m v0.6.3 was released](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/releases/tag/v0.6.3)
* [Embedded WG team was updated](https://github.com/rust-lang/team/pull/376)

[Nominated items](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Arust-embedded+label%3Anominated+is%3Aopen&type=Issues)

* https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/482
    * Either talk to Rust core team about trademark, or use Ferris logo
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/481
    * Further discussion to continue on issue for now
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-quickstart/pull/91
    * Perhaps we can re-add the full build script but with a comment at the top explaining why it's not always necessary so users can delete it if appropraite
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/480
    * New issue to discuss stable deref to allow `Vec<T>` etc
    * Location probably best as a separate crate, to discuss on issue
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/241
    * Remove Into supertrait, add `number(self) -> u16` method
    * Keep copy supertrait
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/239
    * Please discuss on-issue
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/455
    * Waiting on cortex-m#241, discuss again later
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/235
    * Associated consts seems like the best route forwards
    * We can add the associated constants now (in 0.6) and remove `ptr()` methods after a deprecation period (in 0.7)
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/alloc-cortex-m/issues/36
    * Please discuss on-issue
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/209
    * Didn't have time to discuss but perhaps we need to resolve what should go into mutex-trait first
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/169
    * Didn't have time to discuss
