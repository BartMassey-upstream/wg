    * aarch64-cpu 9.3.0, 9.3.1 released
* Cortex-M
    * 0.7.7 released with minor documentation fix for critical-section impl
    * c-m-rt zero-init RAM PR updated https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/455
        * unsure if it should zero before or after pre_init
        * possibly we can skip zeroing bss if all RAM is being zeroed
    * embedded-alloc: cortex-m or hal team?
        * leave it for now?
* Book

* Embedded HAL
    * PwmPin: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/430
        * Keep this design or consider alternative with more methods to get maximum duty value?

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * No meeting on the next two weeks (27th dec and 3rd jan), next meeting on the 10th
    * alloc-cortex-m renamed as embedded-alloc and released at 0.5, now supports any platform via critical-section crate
        * we should release alloc-cortex-m 0.4.4 marking it as deprecated and pointing to the new embedded-alloc
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-alloc/pull/59
        * Published
    * still collecting items for This Year In Embedded Rust, https://github.com/rust-embedded/blog/issues/196
* cortex-m
    * proposed zero-init-ram feature https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/455
        * let's keep it
        * PR needs updating to include documentation and CI tests
* Yank critical-section 0.2.x?
    * yep
* [PwmPin in e-h 1.0?](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/358#issuecomment-1337131621)
    * We discussed at length and settled on a single u16 duty-cycle value where 0=0%, 65535=100%, and the HAL scales intermediate values to map the timer's duty range
