## Agenda

* New micro:bit
    * This doesn't change our plans for the Discovery book, and if anything might help them.
* Potential embedded impl for handle_alloc_error: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66741#issuecomment-706070759
    * Discussed in the meeting. Check back next week. Mention in newsletter.
* Ping from clippy regarding the empty loop lint: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/6161
    * Restoring the lint for no_std seems sensible
    * Not clear what to suggest users put in the loop though
        * On cortex-m, asm::nop is fine
    * See also further discussion in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/6162
