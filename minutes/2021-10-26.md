* MSRV and Rust 2021 Edition (thejpster)
    * We can bump MSRVs as required, but no need to do so until specifically required for some PR
    * Not clear if any 2021 edition features are immediately useful for cortex-m crates
* ARM Fixed Virtual Platforms (thejpster)
    * Perhaps qemu is a good starting point for virtualised testing?
* HIL testing in general

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
* embedded-hal
    * Separate buffers for SPI https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/287
        * Maybe try out some impls?
        * Agreed to support different-length read/write buffers
    * CAN take 4 https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/314
        * Other and Acknowledge errors added
        * Just needs changelog conflict fixing them good to merge.
    * I2C Nack errors https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/316
        * It seems some/many Linux drivers also cannot distinguish address/data nack
        * No consensus yet on whether to have a single Nak variant or use the enum proposed in 316
* cortex-m
    * peripherals::steal zero cost?
        * Related to https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/186 https://github.com/rtic-rs/cortex-m-rtic/issues/321 https://github.com/rtic-rs/cortex-m-rtic/pull/338
        * Current names are confusing but behaviour can't really be changed without breaking soundness
        * Perhaps a new function with a new name could be added for the not-flag-setting behaviour
    * on-target testing
