## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * ESP roadmap https://mabez.dev/blog/posts/esp-rust-24-02-2023/
* Cortex M
    * Declarative macros for c-m-rt?
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/473
        * Not clear the advantages are compelling enough to maintain a whole second set of macros or a second crate
        * Could document the API names used to allow stable unsafe use without macros
        * Could possibly rework the macros without syn/quote, but might require breaking change of removing the static mut support
* Embedded HAL
    * nb with defmt
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/nb/pull/39
        * happy to merge and release 1.1?
        * set feature to enable `dep:defmt` to avoid making a `defmt` feature, which also requires an msrv bump
    * PWM SetDuty https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/430
        * rename trait to SetDutyCycle, and functions similarly
        * otherwise good to merge
    * delay: make infallible https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/432
        * Yep
    * gpio: add ErrorKind https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/431
    * close https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/433 ?
        * Yep
