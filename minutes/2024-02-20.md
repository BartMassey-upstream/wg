## Agenda

* Announcements
    * Reminder about RustNL unconf
* Discovery book
    * Discussed the nrf-hal maintainer situation and whether the discovery book should be ported to use embassy-nrf instead (https://github.com/nrf-rs/nrf-hal/issues/432)
    * Added three volunteers to nrf-rs to merge some outstanding nrf-hal PRs and get it up to shape, which will benefit current users (including an educational course) and the current discovery book
    * Plan to port the BSP crate to embassy-nrf, including non-async interfaces, and use that for an updated version of the discovery book
    * Discovery book to continue to begin with a BSP and only blocking code, but may introduce async and non-BSP HAL usage in later chapters
* Embedded HAL
    * guidance on error handling/propagation of drivers https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/576
    * Infallible CS pins for shared SPI https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/574
