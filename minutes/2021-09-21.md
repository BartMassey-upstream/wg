## Agenda

* Announcements
    * discovery rewrite almost complete! need to sort out generation/hosting of both books
    * thejpster is working 1day/wk on rp2040 support
* cortex-m split up?
    * will start thinking about svd/pac layer
* embedded-hal
    * Reference types
        * Current design basically looks good, pending changelog updates
    * Time types
        * Still unclear how best to solve this for 1.0. Remove DelayMs/DelayUs and hope to re-add something better later?
        * Reached consensus on leaving a delay_us with a fixed u32 type and nothing else, which we can later deprecate and replace with a better Delay in 1.1
    * separate-buffer transfer for SPI
        * perhaps leave the write-data in the read trait as implementation-defined
* Newsletter
    * To be updated v soon, promise
* Writing up send/sync/etc in book
* What makes a First Class experience?
    * Lots of discussion about approaches to improve onboarding experience

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * Gentle code of conduct reminder
* embedded-hal
    * Blanket impls for reference types
        * Error messages are markedly worse than the &mut impl
        * Prevents HALs impl'ing Deref for their own structs
        * Seems rare in the wider Rust ecosystem, not sure why
        * On balance perhaps not the best way to go
    * Time types (https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/177#issuecomment-910396479)
        * Still not clear what one-size-fits-all approach could work
        * Perhaps a Duration trait allowing different storage sizes
        * Might be worth postponing a decision until after e-h 1.0.0 release
        * Duration trait idea was fleshed out more in discussion
* Newsletter
    * Adam's on holiday this week, will add recent announcements to next issue when back
* Write up Send/Sync in book with other platform assumptions / environment?
