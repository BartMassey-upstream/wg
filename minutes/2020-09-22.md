        * Looks good but needs a bit more thought
    * Dummy GPIO pins: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/237
        * Perhaps can wait until 1.1
    * `rand::RngCore` for blocking RNG trait: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/128
        * option 2 seems most promising for e-h 1.0

* cortex-m: Road to 1.0
    * Work out required actions for c-m-sh and merge
    * Release 0.7 soon thereafter
        * This also unblocks svd2rust
    * Plan to release 1.0 as the next release
        * Including new Mutex
        * Probably including splitting cortex-m into a few crates which can be used separately
