## Action Items

## Last Week's Minutes

Check in on action items from last week:

*  Investigate if we can use LLVM to build cortex-m pre-built objects, removing the need to install ARM gcc

Focus Issues:

* DMA
    * Nothing to report
 
* C/Rust Interop?
    * No real interest in the meeting, maybe drop it?

Discussed issues:

* https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/491
    * @thejpster to move embedded-nal into the community org
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/482
    * @eldruin to summarize the tricky situation so the WG can make a decision how to follow up here
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/issues/262
    * Maybe the book is too lowlevel to pick up newcomers interested in Rust on embedded. The environment has vastly matured since the discovery book came out so maybe it's not addressing matters at an appropriate level anymore.

## Last Week's Action Items

* Swap cortex-m to use apt to install arm-none-eabi-gcc
