## Agenda

* Announcements
    * Rust leadership RFC merged, leadership council now exists
        * https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/06/20/introducing-leadership-council.html
* Bors
    * Started not responding, so accelerating change to GHMQ
* Book translations
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/book/issues/326#issuecomment-1580987514
    * No updates this week
* Cortex-M
    * Hardfault trampline
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/476
        * Test issue resolved, tests to be added then ready to merge
* svd2rust
    * per-peripheral steal() https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/723
    * global steal() not setting flag https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/735
    * Conclusion so far:
        * Peripherals::steal() sets DEVICE_PERIPHERALS so that frameworks like RTIC can use steal() when they want to avoid the unwrap associated with take() (as they know they are running before user code so take wouldn't fail) but still set the flag so that user code cannot later take() and end up with duplicate peripherals
        * This wasn't a documented safety contract...
        * Still, it seems work keeping for backwards compatibility with RTIC
        * However, new per-peripheral steal() does not need to honour this; instead its safety invariants can be documented (e.g. ensure having stolen that no one else will be using it at the same time)
        * So in conclusion, close 735 without merging, but merge 723 with associated function steal per-peripheral
* embedded-hal
    * Swapping to GHMQ and then ready to merge spi::operation

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
* Meeting format
    * Keep using @room notifications?
        * Yes
    * Keep attendance list in minutes?
        * Yes
* Bors
    * No update this week
* Book translations
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/book/issues/326#issuecomment-1580987514
    * Pointed out that translations could still be separate books even with PO files
* Cortex-M
    * Hardfault trampoline: https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/47
        * no update this week
* svd2rust
    * per-peripheral steal() https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/723
        * Haven't heard anything from japaric about why steal set the global flag
        * concluded we can change the PR to an associated function and also PR
            having Peripherals::steal not set the global flag
* embedded-hal
    * spi Operation::DelayUs https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/462 
    * seems we can go ahead with this
