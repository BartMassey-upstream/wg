## Agenda

* Announcements
    * cortex-m v0.7.3 released
    * @therealprof has submitted an LLVM patch for unsigned saturating arithemtic on cortex-m
* embedded-hal
    * brief discussion about a potential Duration type or trait, or how it might interact with core's Duration, or embedded-time's Duration
* the road to 1.0 (again!)
    * recapped current state of 1.0 crates
        * r0, nb both 1.0, but we've had to deprecate r0 and might eventually deprecate nb
        * momentum has faltered on cortex-m and cortex-m-rt crates getting to 1.0
        * embedded-hal 1.0 has had a lot of interest and development
    * discussed perhaps pushing more crates towards 1.0 to reflect their current stability and widespread use
    * discussed cortex-m-rt's static mut transformation as a potential blocker on the way to releasing a 1.0
        * Perhaps the interrupt resource management can be turned into a separate crate?
