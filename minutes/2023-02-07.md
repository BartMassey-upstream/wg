## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * probe-rs 0.16
    * stm32-eth 0.4
* aarch64-cpu maintainers wanted
* Embedded HAL
    * Delay via shared ref? https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/435
        * It seems like the problem is better solved by encouraging multiple Delays to be easily created
        * cortex-m could provide this as an example/delay-of-last-resort
        * discussed having a new Delay in cortex-m that watches SYST for wraparounds without writing to it, so multiple can co-exist
        * perhaps also one based on asm::delay
    * PwmPin naming
* pac/svd2rust
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/issues/708 question that needs an answer, accessing W without closure
        * Possibly `write()` could return W which could then be used in future `write` calls
        * chiptool already solves this by combining R/W proxies into "register value" struct
