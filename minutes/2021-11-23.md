    * cargo-binutils 0.3.4 released
    * newsletter #30 published
    * embedded-hal 1.0-alpha.6 released
* cross
    * RFC coming soon
    * port to GHCR in progress [cross#609](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross/pull/609)
        * currently ci/test.sh is hanging at qemu-system runner on powerpc64-unknown-linux-gnu and sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu targets
        * qemu is not linking correctly on x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu target
* discovery book rewrite
    * PR to merge rewrite is up, please check over / proof read / feedback https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/pull/414
* newsletter
    * published!
    * please add anything you'd like in the next edition via PR to https://github.com/rust-embedded/blog/blob/master/content/newsletter-next.md
* cortex-m
    * cortex-m-rt https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt/pull/337 merged, maybe new release soon?
    * should we reconsider cortex-m-rt writing to SP and VTOR at boot?
        * it _shouldn't_ be necessary except to work around broken bootloaders, debuggers, etc
        * it doesn't add _much_ overhead
        * it turns out it's permissible to write to a non-existent VTOR on ARMv6
        * with global_asm, we could easily feature-gate to make this an optional quirks-mode thing, but without it we'd need to ship many more precompiled blobs
* embedded-hal
    * alpha.6 released!

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * RFC for static async fns in traits approved https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3185

    * no answer from t-infra, dpc has offered to help with new org
    * New org?
    * post on call for help issue/status update
    * not sure about permissions to access azure pipelines and/or update dockerhub secrets
    * dockerhub team is now overfull and needs personal access tokens to publish, probably move to ghcr

* embedded-hal
* newsletter
* cargo-binutils
    * new release required

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * Inline asm hopefully stabilising soon! https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/72016#issuecomment-964186287
* cross
    * Reviving the call for new maintainers https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross/issues/574
    * New org for cross maintenance?
        * Keep this under rust-embedded control?
        * Or just add new maintainers to existing repo?
    * rust-lang/infra have a meeting in a week, could ask for their opinion (they use cross?)
    * new Matrix room for cross: https://matrix.to/#/#cross-rs:matrix.org
* embedded-hal
    * Remove traits with Time associated types https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/324
        * Removes a lot of traits, which might make 1.0 quite unappealing until it has them back, or lead to people using 0.2 and 1.0 together
        * On the other hand, the unbound Time type might mean these traits are already rarely used in drivers, in which case they might not be missed from 1.0
        * Perhaps we should take them out now and consider re-adding in a 1.1 if people complain or miss them, even if we can't fix Time for good yet
* cortex-m
* svd2rust
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd/issues/164 : Proposal: struct instead of enum for arrays
        * Maybe `serde(untagged)` would work well
        * Discuss on issue thread
* newsletter
