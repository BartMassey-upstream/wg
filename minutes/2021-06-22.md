## Agenda

* Announcements
    * None this week
* embedded-hal
    * New PR adding futures-based traits https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/285
        * Lots of discussion about these proposed traits
        * Should they be unsafe?
        * Could Rust gain a way to indicate "must not leak"?
        * How to handle full-duplex? (perhaps new traits to take either two separate buffers or just one in-place buffer)
        * Should they use slices (yes)
        * Should they use embedded-dma buffers? (probably no)

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * IRC channel operational on Libera
* cross
    * Release?
    * Post call for maintainers
* embedded-hal
    * Rename send to write https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/281
    * blocking::serial names https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/280
    * both PRs discussed, so far conclusion is:
            * remove prelude so we can easily have overlapping method names between traits
            * update traits to make send/write/bwrite/etc methods all consistent across blocking/nonblocking traits
            * essentially, approve both these PRs and also remove the prelude
* blog
    * Publish once we can add cross call for help
