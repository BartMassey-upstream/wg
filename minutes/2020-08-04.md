## Agenda

Nominated issues from last week:

* C/Rust interop https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/481
    * Perhaps a candidate for a focus project?
* DMA crate name https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/480
    * Going ahead with embedded-dma, @thalesfragoso to create repo
* DMA crate traits https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/486
    * Will publish crate soon with 0.0.1 of traits
    * Various implementations in HALs are coming along
* New InterruptNumber traits https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/455
    * We can probably go ahead with the cortex-m and msp430 changes in svd2rust now, but still need to work out what will happen in riscv
* TLSF allocator https://github.com/rust-embedded/alloc-cortex-m/issues/36
    * No update this week
* Cortex-M issues
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/239
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/209
        * More thought needed on Mutex trait
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/169
        * Closed
    * New this week: https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt/issues/283
        * Perhaps not our place to fix SR, and user can write VTOR themselves
* DummyPins HAL https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/237
* What's the status of https://github.com/rust-embedded/fixedvec-rs
    * No highfive setup, rust-embedded/fixedvec-rs#13 has been unreviewed for >1 year
    * Will open issue to investigate
* CI should not download ARM-GCC from Arm's servers. Any ideas for how to get a toolchain more reliably?
    * We can try arm-none-eabi-gcc from apt, which is newer now we're using GHA
    * Investigate on cortex-m-rt

## Action Items

* Create new embedded-dma repository and publish first release
* Open InterruptNumber issues on risc-v and msp430 repos
* Open issue on fixedvec to investigate status
* Try using apt's arm gcc on cortex-m-rt

## Last Week's Minutes

Nominated items from last week:

* https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/481
    * Please leave comments on the issue
    * Revisit next week to see if there's any movement
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/480
    * We'll go with its own crate, perhaps `embedded-dma`
    * Please comment on the issue thread
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/455
    * The related PR in cortex-m#241 landed.
    * The svd2rust issue will wait until cortex-m 0.7 is released with the new InterruptNumber trait
    * For msp430 the old Nr impl wasn't actually used, so can be removed without replacement
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/alloc-cortex-m/issues/36
    * We could transfer tlsf to help maintenance on it
    * Perhaps a new cortex-m-tlsf allocator crate
    * Also noted that there is movement towards allocators on stable no-std Rust soon
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/239
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/209
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/169
* We didn't get to discuss the cortex-m issues above which probably need more careful time; perhaps a dedicated cortex-m team meeting is called for

New nominated items:

* https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/486
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/237

Closed issues from last week:
* New associated const PTRs added to cortex-m and svd2rust
* InterruptNumber trait landed in cortex-m
* build script re-added to cortex-m-quickstart

## Last Week's Action Items

* Open issues on risc-v and msp430 arch crates about InterruptNumber changes
