    * No update this week
* Book translations
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/book/issues/326#issuecomment-1580987514
    * Pointed out that translations could still be separate books even with PO files
* Cortex-M
    * Hardfault trampoline: https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/47
        * no update this week
* svd2rust
    * per-peripheral steal() https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/723
        * Haven't heard anything from japaric about why steal set the global flag
        * concluded we can change the PR to an associated function and also PR
            having Peripherals::steal not set the global flag
* embedded-hal
    * spi Operation::DelayUs https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/462 
    * seems we can go ahead with this

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * svd2rust 0.29 released https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/releases/tag/v0.29.0
* Bors
    * svd, svd2rust repos moved to ghmq
* Book translations
    * No update this week
* Cortex-m
    * Hardfault trampoline https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/476
        * WIP on making it an argument to the exception macro instead of Cargo feature
* svd2rust
    * per-peripheral steal() https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/723
        * discussed this further; some more positive arguments for adding it based on widespread use of Peripherals::steal() to obtain a single peripheral, but need to confirm why Peripherals::steal() sets the global flag that take() checks, and therefore whether per-peripheral steal() should too
* embedded-hal
    * spi Operation::DelayUs https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/462 
        * did not discuss this week
