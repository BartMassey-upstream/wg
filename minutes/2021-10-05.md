    * stm32-rs 0.14 released
    * svd-parser 0.10 split into
        * svd-rs 0.11 https://crates.io/crates/svd-rs
        * svd-encoder 0.11 https://crates.io/crates/svd-encoder
        * svd-parser 0.11 https://crates.io/crates/svd-parser
    * cortex-m-rt 0.6.11-0.6.14 yanked
* discovery rewrite
    * final polishing https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/pull/407
        * Probably hitting multiple cortex-m-rt versions issue
        * Blocked on an nrf-rs PR for now
* embedded-hal
    * Impls for references merged :tada:
    * Error traits https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/296
        * Almost there, final concerns about NoAck variants in i2c
    * DelayUs unification https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/312
        * Good to go, merging
    * Separate buffers for SPI https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/287
        * Looks good, waiting for feedback from ryankurte on implementation-defined fill values
    * CAN take 4 https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/314
        * Error variants currently match the CAN specification's list of errors, so probably keep them like that
        * Otherwise looks good, waiting a few days to maybe add an Other error type and last checks
* newsletter
    * Add anything you'd like posted!
* svd2rust
    * svd2rust update to 0.11 svd-parser crates https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/542
        * Small regression on esp32 being fixed in esp32 repo

    * Follow up on https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross/issues/574, where are we?
        * No update/progress
        * New PR updating a bunch of versions https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross/pull/591
