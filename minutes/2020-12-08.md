## Action Items

## Last Week's Minutes

* Action item recap
* Announcements: MSRV update merged
* Scheduled CI for repos
    * Test on one repo first, then copy to others
    * How do we want notifications? Matrix/IRC, email, opening an issue?
    * Seems like opening an issue is perhaps best, investigate details in a PR
* cortex-m releases
    * need to get a c-m-sh that supports c-m 0.7 out
    * annoyingly stuck with dependencies
    * might be easiest to do c-m-sh 0.3.6 with c-m 0.7 support first
* svd2rust recent AVR breakage
    * we don't currently officially support or test for AVR
    * perhaps someone from avr-rust can add official support, or even form an AVR team in the WG, but even if not we should fix the recent bug

## Last Week's Action Items

* Newsletter release
    * Mention MSRV policy
* Implement scheduled CI for one repository to check how it works,
  with a view to rolling the same recipe out to other repos aftewards.
* Investigate potential for cortex-m 0.6.5 semver hack
* cortex-m-rt release
* svd2rust release
