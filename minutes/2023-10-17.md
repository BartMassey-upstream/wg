## Agenda

* Announcements
    * svdtools 0.3.4 released
* Anti-spam bot issue check
* New libs team
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/pull/707
* wg readme update
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/pull/708
    * If no objections we can merge this
* Rust target maintainers
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/704
    * Ready to submit PR, please do any final checks for RV32/MSP430/Cortex-M
* embedded-io
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/513 - What do we do with the 0.6 release?
* cortex-m-interrupt-number
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/488
    * is this a breaking change for cortex-m 0.7?
    * Test how this works out with a PAC that uses IN from c-m 0.7, and how it changes when the PAC uses the new c-m-in instead.
* Mutex trait
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/mutex-trait/issues/13
* volatile-register:
    * Should be able to move this to rewg soon and release an updated version to fix the unsoundness
* heapless:
    * Should also be able to move to rewg soon

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * probe-rs 0.21.0 released
* Anti-spam bot issue check
* Rust target maintainers
    * Issue tracked in https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/704
* Mutex-trait
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/mutex-trait/issues/13
    * no further discussion this week, should still decide if we want to continue promoting this trait
* book: tooling page needs updating
* bors: ops docs needs updating
* cortex-m volatile-register: still no update on PR
    * Perhaps just vendor our own volatileregister for now? it's only a few lines of code
    * unfortunately this is a breaking change and we don't want to release cortex-m 0.8 with just this
        * in part because all the PACs depend on cortex-m so it wrecks the ecosystem
        * perhaps we can have cortex-m-nr with just the InterruptNumber crate for PACs to use
    * plan:
        * make new cortex-m-interrupt-number crate with just the trait
        * have new cortex-m 0.7.8 re-export that trait
        * update svd2rust to use new crate directly instead of through cortex-m
        * now we can make new breaking cortex-m changes without all pacs needing updating
        * and thus also fix issues like this
        * perhaps also make PACs not depend on c-m-rt and just export the interrupt enum,
          with end users using the c-m-rt macro directly
* move heapless to r-e-c? can someone ask @japaric to transfer the repo?
