## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
* cortex-m
    * itm crate ownership transferred, repository archived
        * waiting on new cortex-m release with PR 342 before new itm release is possible
    * new release with fixed asm?
        * backport and cut a new 0.7
        * check for any other PRs that can be backported
    * 0.8 alpha?
        * annoying to do another breaking change fairly soon after 0.7 and would require another semver-hack release, but there's also the break to vectactive register size
* tools
    * cross RFC
        * open discussions still need feedback/resolving
* embedded-hal
    * new async traits: separate crate/repo/?
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/pull/594
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/334
    * unify error types between traits (both read/write, and async/nb/blocking)
        * do we want to unify between async/nb/blocking?
        * does async ever need different error types than blocking?
* this year in rust
    * https://hackmd.io/@znpl-20YQ0icKHOXR9EpQw/SywUu_iqK
        * add links to all the chip family projects and matrix rooms
        * and other projects like probe-rs (+hs-probe), rtic, embassy, knurling, smoltcp, hubris
        * format repo stats into a table
* two week break, next meeting 11th Jan
