## Agenda

* Announcements
    * cortex-m-rt 0.7.2 released
        * MSRV bumped to use new stable asm, no more precompiled blobs
        * Adds set-vtor and set-sp features
    * riscv 0.10 released with critical-section impl
    * a few new async crates using e-h-a and e-n-a (and new crates released from embassy):
        - reqwless 0.2 - async http client
        - esp8266-at-driver
        - es-wifi-driver
        - rak811-at-driver
        - hts221-async
* Async interrupt registration, take 3 (only in HAL approach)
    * The other end of the spectrum, no crate needed only a simple macro-by-example in a HAL + marker trait. When HALs are not forced to adhere to an API via a crate (eg `cortex-m-interrupt`), will it be enough with the simpler solution that needs to be disiminated in a different way?
* Newsletter: looking for volunteers
* Maybe run another last-friday-of-the-month Twitter project roundup?
* Discussed structure of driver crates offering both blocking and async drivers

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * alloc-cortex-m 0.4.3 released
    * svd2rust 0.27.2 released
    * riscv-rt 0.10.0 released
    * cortex-a crate renamed aarch64-cpu and released at v9.0
* `cortex-m-interrupt` now with const registration and M:N interrupt:driver connections, feedback welcome
    * https://github.com/datdenkikniet/cortex-m-interrupt/blob/const-approach/cortex-m-interrupt-examples/examples/register_interrupt.rs
* critical-section on msp430 bloat:
    * can be worked-around by putting the msp430 impl inside the c-s crate and removing the 'extern rust' calls
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/critical-section/compare/main...cr1901:msp430-cs:msp430-cs
        * But it's not clear yet how to fix this longer-term, it seems like most likely a bug in LLVM or Rust's inliner
