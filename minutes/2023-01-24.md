    * Mysterious bug in semihosting?
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/459
        * Seems likely to be a qemu issue, though we could
          possibly work around with a nop in debug::exit,
          which has pretty low overhead since it's only
          used at the end of tests
    * c-m-rt zero-init RAM PR https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/455
* Embedded HAL
    * PwmPin trait? https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/430
        * New suggestion avoids some extra computation
    * GPIO ErrorKind https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/431#pullrequestreview-1249623337
    * embedded-alloc to HAL team?
        * leave with cortex-m for now
* Risc-V
    * Critical section bug? https://github.com/rust-embedded/riscv/pull/121
