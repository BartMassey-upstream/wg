## Agenda

* Announcements
    * embedded-hal v1.0.0 released! :tada: 
    * risc-v releases: risc-v 0.11, riscv-rt 0.12, riscv-pac 0.1, riscv-semihosting 0.1
    * linux-embedded-hal 0.4 was released with embedded-hal updated to 1.0
* Commonality between cortex-m and riscv interrupt macros
    * Could we unify the interrupt-declaring syntax?
    * Currently riscv-rt just has the user export a suitably-named symbol, which would also work for c-m-rt
        * But this doesn't permit the &static mut transform, or ensure that the method can't be called except by hardware as an interrupt, and doesn't check the function type signature
        * We could recommend this for c-m-rt
    * Could c-m-rt's interrupt macro take the interrupt name as an (optional?) argument, so the function could then be named arbitrarily instead?
        * avr-device requires the chip name be passed to the interrupt macro, so couldn't immediately work with this syntax, but maybe could be refactored later to support it
    * What about exception macros (e.g. when used to provide the exceptionframe in a hardfault on c-m-rt) or the entry macro (which also provides the static mut transform)?
    * TBC

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * Welcome @sirhcel to the WG and linux team!
    * Miscompilation in current stable with opt-level=z on cortex-m https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/discussions/503
    * https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/118645 should hopefully bring more f32 functions to embedded platforms
    * Rust 1.75 released, with async-fn-in-trait! :tada: 
    * Embassy (https://embassy.dev) now works on stable Rust
* Embedded HAL
    * GPIO &mut https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/547
        * Extensive further discussion on this point
        * HAL team to conclude with a vote

Not discussed this week:
* cortex-m fence inline asm maybe shouldn't have nomem? https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/502
    * yes, they shouldn't. we'll want to backport the fix to 0.7 too
* cortex-m VectActive in 0.7.7 https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/499
    * the -16 fix could be backported to 0.7.8
* cortex-m-rt extra section example soundness https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/498
* cargo-binutils release?
    * Yes, when CI failures are resolved
* C-m-pac-interface: rename, test
* mutex-trait: awaiting deprecation rfc
* book: tooling page updates
* bors: ops docs
* rustc targets: awaiting feedback
